# Impulses

Source Nodes are only executed once per graph execution.

What if you would like run such a node several times using different parameters?

If you select such nodes, you'll see that they feature an option called "Impulse" that will make an input port appear.

Entities that comes into these inputs are discarded, but not without triggering the node first. Attributes that were defined in the input entities will be copied to the entities generated by the source node.

In the following example, empty entities are created (with an index attribute) to trigger the "Mesh Create" Node 10 times, creating 10 spheres with different properties. Notice that the 'index' attribute of the original entities are copied to the created spheres.
