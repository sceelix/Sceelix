Procedural generation has been around for many years, and its popularity has risen in the latest years with release of titles such as [Spore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_(2008_video_game)), [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft), [No Man's Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Man%27s_Sky), to name a few. In film/tv production, the [Lord of The Rings films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)), [300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)) or [Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones) are known examples that use procedural techniques in their workflows.

The goal of Sceelix is to make such procedural generation technologies more mainstream and accessible to everyone.
